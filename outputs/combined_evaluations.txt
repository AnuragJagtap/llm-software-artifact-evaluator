SRS Evaluation
==============

Requirements Completeness:
  score: 6
  reason: The SRS covers basic functional and non-functional requirements, but lacks details on book management, user authentication, and error handling.

Clarity & Unambiguity:
  score: 8
  reason: Requirements are generally clear and concise, but some terms (e.g., 'unique Book ID') could be further clarified.

Consistency:
  score: 9
  reason: The SRS is generally consistent, but the assumption of single-user access may conflict with the requirement for a standalone application.

Verifiability & Testability:
  score: 7
  reason: Most requirements can be verified or tested, but some (e.g., NFR1) lack specific metrics or criteria for evaluation.

Structure & Standard Compliance:
  score: 5
  reason: The SRS does not follow standard SRS formats (e.g., IEEE 830 / IEEE 29148) and lacks proper sections and hierarchy.

Overall Score: 6.8
================================================================================

Code Generation Evaluation
==========================

Functional Correctness:
  score: 8
  reason: The code correctly solves the problem for most valid inputs, but it does not handle the case where a user tries to issue a book with a non-existent ID.

Compilation / Execution Validity:
  score: 10
  reason: The code is free from syntax and runtime errors.

Algorithmic Efficiency:
  score: 6
  reason: The time complexity of the code is O(n) for the listBooks method, which is not optimal. The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of a HashMap to store books.

Readability & Maintainability:
  score: 9
  reason: The code is clean and readable, but it could benefit from more comments and a more consistent naming convention.

Edge Case Handling:
  score: 7
  reason: The code correctly handles some edge cases, such as trying to add a book with a non-unique ID, but it does not handle the case where a user tries to issue a book with a non-existent ID or a book with no copies available.

Overall Score: 7.6
================================================================================

Test Case Evaluation
====================

Test Case Coverage:
  score: 8
  reason: The test cases cover normal and boundary input scenarios, but lack extreme input scenarios, such as adding a book with a negative number of copies or issuing a book with a non-existent ID.

Edge Case Effectiveness:
  score: 6
  reason: The test cases include some meaningful edge cases, such as adding a duplicate book and issuing a book when no copies are available, but lack others, such as returning a book with no copies available or listing books with invalid IDs.

Input Validity & Constraints Compliance:
  score: 9
  reason: The test inputs are generally valid and well-formed, but the input for Test Case 4 (issueBook(999)) is invalid because the book ID 999 does not exist in the system.

Expected Output Correctness:
  score: 9
  reason: The expected outputs are generally accurate and logically consistent with the problem specification, but the expected output for Test Case 4 is incorrect because the book ID 999 does not exist in the system.

Redundancy & Diversity:
  score: 7
  reason: The test cases are generally diverse, but Test Case 2 (addDuplicateBook) is redundant because it is similar to Test Case 1 (addNewBook).

Overall Score: 7.6
